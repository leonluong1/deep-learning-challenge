# Alphabet Soup Neural Network Data Analysis
Module 21 Deep Learning Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining the data of applicants that were funded by AlphabetSoup. We took this data and analyzed their results using a Deep Learning Neural Network model. We have a Jupyter Notebook file that contains starter code. 

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my machine learning, neural network and tensorflow knowledge. I created a dataframe to store the charity data. Then, I preprocessed that data by getting rid of identification columns and turning categorical data into numerical data. Then, I created my initial neural network model and tried to optimize it as much as possible. Finally, I created a report that describe our models and their results.

The file types in this repository are ipynb, csv, h5 and md files.
